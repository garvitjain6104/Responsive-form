**Form Link:**🔗https://garvitjain6104.github.io/Responsive-form/

This project demonstrates a responsive contact form built with **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**. The core focus is on user experience and data integrity. I implemented custom validation logic using Regex to verify email formats and input lengths in real-time. Instead of relying on default browser alerts, the interface provides immediate visual feedback (error states and success messages) to guide the user, ensuring that only valid data is processed for submission.
